Ultra-photorealistic 8K HDR cinematic image of a confident, sensual Vietnamese woman. Authentic Vietnamese facial structure, luminous fair skin with soft pink undertone and micro-water droplets on shoulders, collarbone, and abdomen. Ultra-long light-purple wavy hair, voluminous, silky, layered curls flowing dynamically, iridescent violet-silver reflections. Athletic yet feminine body, 15% enhanced bust, 10% fuller hips, firm abdomen, toned arms, long smooth legs. Confident, slightly flirtatious expression, half-closed eyes, calm smile. Wearing a luxury two-piece bikini in deep royal blue (British flag blue) with gold metallic connectors, wet reflective fabric, high-fashion swimwear editorial style, no jewelry. Posing beside a pink Lamborghini Aventador supercar on a luxury coastal road near a modern villa, palm trees and distant architecture softly blurred under natural HDRI daylight (6500K). Vibrant, elegant, summery atmosphere. Pivoting gracefully away from the open driver's side door of the pink Lamborghini, looking back over her shoulder with a confident, slightly flirtatious expression, one hand casually resting on the door frame, the other subtly placed on her hip, showcasing her athletic yet feminine form. A dynamic, eye-level cinematic shot from just inside the car, framed by the door's opening, capturing her graceful pivot and direct gaze, with the scenic coastal road and villa subtly visible in the background. 85mm f/1.4 full-frame portrait lens, shallow DOF, tack-sharp focus on face, bikini fabric, and skin highlights. PBR, spectral light simulation, global illumination, subsurface scattering, advanced ray-traced pipeline, multi-layer skin shader, hair strand scattering, true DSLR optical emulation, ACEScg filmic curve, soft bloom, film vignette, warm color LUT to enhance fair tones., variation 3
